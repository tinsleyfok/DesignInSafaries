            <h2>Final Iteration </h2>
            <p>Based on the feedback from Lou, expert from England cottontail breeding program at Roger Williams Zoo and Scott, expert from Queen zoo, Mariah and I finally designed and developed a music enrichment device to help female reduce stress. Below is the documentation of our device from concept to execution. </p> <br />

            <h2> New England Cottontail </h2><br />
            <div class="big-img"><img src="../image/newengland.png"></div>
            <h2>Captive Breeding Programs:
                Increasing Survival in Cottontails Reintroduced into the Wild</h2>
            <p>The New England Cottontail was once abundant in the Northeastern United States. However, it's population has dwindled since 1960 primarily due to human development's impact on the Cottontail's environment in combination with infringement from the only other rabbit species seen in the region today, the Eastern Cottontail. This new species was introduces by hunting organizations and is not native to the region, but due to it's keener eye sight as compared to the New England Cottontail, it survives more predator attacks leaving the New England Cottontail more vulnerable. A serious decrease in thicket habitat has also led to this decline, giving less hiding places to the rabbit and forcing them to travel farther from the hiding places that exist in order to forage for food.<br /><br />

                Since 2010, there has been a grand effort by 6 states partnering to increase the New England Cottontail population through captive breeding programs primarily run out of the Roger Williams Zoo in Rhode Island, the Queens Zoo in New York, and organizations out of Maine and New Hampshire. The other states include Massacusetts and Connecticut.<br /><br />

                The rabbits were listed on the endangered list until 2015, when it was deemed that the 6-state effort to increase the population with captive breeding and release posed a positive outlook for the species. However, in 2017 in the Department of Inland Fishers (Maine) release effort, most of the 18 New England cottontails brought into the state died primarily due to predation.</p> <br />

            <h2> First Prototype - Anti-predator device </h2>
            <p>The main threat to survivorship of England Cottontail is their habitat. Lack of proper habitat leads the decreasing survivorship. Besides, predator, food hunting and reproduction are also the threats to their survivorship. Since we cannot make a big change on the habitat, we focus on research anti-predator training at the first place. Our first prototype is an anti-predator training device that train rabbit to dig when the device releases the smell of predator. However, our first prototype is problematic because the odor from predator is hard to carried and the device potentially scare the rabbit. </p>

            <h2> Second Prototype - Anti-predator device </h2>
            <p>Our first prototype was an anti-predator training device that was designed to train the rabbits to dig when the device released the smell of predator. <br />
                FEEDBACK: <br />
                - The odor from predator is hard to be carried and released in a silo<br />
                - The device may stress the rabbit<br /></p>
            <div class="big-img"><img src="../image/pro2.png"></div><br />
            <h2> Third Prototype - Anti-predator device </h2>
            <p>Our 3rd prototype was an iteration on the hiding pen but with no tech and a plan for cost-effective materials. <br />
                FEEDBACK: <br />
                - “Rabbits breed like they breed because they die like they die” - Lou Perotti
                - Rabbits’ place in the ecosystem means they are meant to be prey
                - They haven’t seen a big difference in survival rates of rabbits released directly into the wild vs. those transitioned in hardening pens.

            <h2> Research</h2>
            <p>
                We had a conversation with Lou Perrotti (breeding program manager, Roger Williams Zoo), and then we shift our idea to 1st pregnancy in female rabbits. In 1st pregnancy, mothers neglect or sometimes mutilate/consume their young, which doesn’t happen in 2nd, 3rd pregnancies.Most babies die within first 3 days. After 4-5 days, they are usually OK.
                and we came up questions like What is it about this 1st pregnancy that goes wrong?
                How can something be created to help test an improved parent-child experience
                which will in turn increase kit production and survivorship?

                <br /> <br />

                And we also had a conversation with Scott Silver (breeding program manager, Queens Zoo).
                He said 1st pregnancy each year goes wrong (around March-April), but he did not know what led to this problem, maybe temperature or Time of year. They also attempt to provide rabbits larger spaces during breeding (3ft x 8ft runs at Queens Zoo).Nursing goes poorly: Unclear if this is mother being triggered by her weak babies and therefore initiating negative behavior, or if mother initially neglects to nurse her babies which leads to their weakening and higher levels of stress for mother.

            <h2>Two-pronged Research: Causes for Violent Parental Displays & Stress Reduction in Rabbits
            </h2>
            <p>
                Violent parental displays towards their young:<br />
                - 3 main causes: 1. Stress/fear/disturbance, 2. malnutrition (lactational demands from young will intensify deficiency between mother), or 3. simply as a vice<br />
                - Parental Injuries to Offspring: Infanticide (Study, Dr. Philip Evans)<br />
                Commercially available music for rabbits shown to reduce stress (cortisol levels):<br />
                - When introduced to soundtrack for 6 months, fecal cortisol levels significantly decreased, suggesting a proven reduction of stress<br />

            <h2>ideation
            </h2>
            <p>- Use music to relieve stress and agitation in mother (which could be caused by a number of things discussed earlier)<br />
                - Intervene at point in which mother is close to her children (proximity triggered)<br />
                - Create housing that will encompass audio player in a non-disruptive fashion
            </p>
            <div class="big-img"><img src="../image/test1.png"></div><br /><br />
            <h2>Device Iteraction
            </h2>
            <p>Our device will be placed beside the newborns for the first 3 days after the mother gives birth (the greatest risk time).When the mother wanders near
                the newborns, the ultrasonic sensor inside the device will sense this presence and trigger soothing
                music to be played.
            </p>
            <div class="big-img"><img src="../image/flow3.png"></div><br /><br />
            <h2>Form Factor</h2>
            <p>- Holes on each side for music to get through
                - Wrapped with hay to better simulate natural habitat (to not add additional stress with foreign object)
                - Used MDF wood to better mimic the color of thicket environment, also cost effective ($4/2ft. square)
            </p>
            <div class="big-img"><img src="../image/test2.png"></div><br /><br />
            <h2>Animal-centric Design </h2>
            <p>For the doe to be taking care of its newborns, it has to be in an extremely comfortable and familiar environment. It also need to have abundant supply of food and water. To make the mother rabbit stress free, we designed the device based on various researches pointing to a correlation with animals listening to music and reduced stress levels. With this animal-centric design we hope to reduce the rate of which a doe would cannibalize its babies.Device should be non-disruptive in appearance</p>

            <h2>Feedback: from Scott</h2>
            <p>“Love the idea that you’re looking for a novel way to approach the pregnancy issue"<br />
                - Him and Lou have been trying to solve the issue for 5 years<br />
                - He can’t prove this wouldn’t work, but can’t prove it would work<br />
                - In order to advance to a testing stage, he feels the zoo should collect fecal samples from the first pregnancy to see if there’s an increased stress level<br />
                - First pregnancy for the year is already taking place, so this would likely not be able to be tested until the following spring
