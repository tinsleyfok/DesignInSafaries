            <h1>Assignment: Zoo Visit + Ethogram </h1>
            <p>In this week, the class went to Central Park Zoo and we were asked to observe an animal for at least 30mins. From the Polar Circle zone, I chose one of the penguins to observe since I did lots of research on polar bear previously. I would be better to keep observing the similar species.</p><br />
            <h2>Penguin | 3/2/2019 12:50PM - 1:20PM </h2>
            <p> I used pen and paper to record during observation. I divided the behavior into pool behaviors and out of pool behaviors. Pool behaviors including surface swimming, underwater swimming and porpoising. Out of pool behaviors including inactive, locomotion, preening, affiliative and feeding.

             <h2>Ethogram </h2>   
            <div class="big-img"><img src="../image/penguin2.png"></div> <br /><br />
            <h2>Homunculus Diagram</h2>
            <p>I focused on observing one penguin but it was not an active penguin. In the half an hour, it spent most of the time standing, scratching its back body and shaking its head. Based on this penguin, I made the Homunculus Diagram.The month becomes not that sharp but longer. The hand becomes longer and the feet become large becuase the genguin dose not move yet only strach using its month.</p><br />
