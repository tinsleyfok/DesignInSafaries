            <h1>  Assignment: Enrichment II</h1><br />
        
              <p>In this week, we need to create a more detailed proposal for enrichment machine, research further and develop a draft for a function prototype.
              </p>
              <p>I looked into how polar bear wait and catch theor preys(seal) this week. I found two typical ways: 1. Wait inside the water and slowly come closed to the seal which floats on the ice. 2. Stay on the floating ice and put their head to the water to smell the seal, once the seal swim to the zone, polar bear jumps into the water and catch the seal. In my proposal, I want to recreate the first behavior. </p>

            <h1>  Enrichment idea:</h1>
            <p>Based on the feedback I got last week, I modify the part related to ice. Since the polar bear have adapted the warm weather, I take out the ice basement. Polar bear has a very good sense of smell. It could smell food within a kilometer. I design to put the feeding machine above the water(swiming pool) far away the polar bear. Once the polar bear smells the food, It will swim to the feeding machine, just like the polar bear in the wildï¼šthey slip into seal. I choose foam(light) as material to build the basement of the feeding machine, which makes it look like the floating ice that can float on the water.  I add a motor on the top of the vertical stand and a motion detected sensor on the end of the horizontal stand. Once the sensor detects motion, the motor changes the orientation of the horizontal stand, causing polar bear to miss food for the first time. When polar bear jump to the foam and try to get the food on the basket, the basket moves, just like the seal run when polar bear catch them. Polar bear needs to put in effort to catch the preys. After several attempts, when polar bear takes the basket off, it needs to tear the basket apart to get the food.  </p><br />
