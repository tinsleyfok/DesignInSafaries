            <h1>Assignment: Empathy Machine </h1><br /><br />
            <p>This week assignment is to create a technical working prototype that allows a human to experience animal senses/locomotion or other animal processes. And I came up two ideas: one is digital, one is physical</p><br />
            <h2>First Task:</h2>
            <p> I want to simulate the experience of a hungry cheetah that finds and catches the prey. </p><br />
            <h2>Focus on: Fast</h2><br /><br />
            <h2>Mission:</h2>
            <h2>Step1:Bring users into the scenario</h2>
            <p> Scenario: the cheetah hadn't caught any preys for two days when it suddenly saw a gray duikers. If it dosen't run faster, it will continue to starve.<br /><br />
                Let the users feel like:<br />
                1.He/she is a cheetah<br />
                2.He/she is hungry<br /><br /></p>
            <h2>Step2: let users experience cheetah's senses</h2>
            <p> In this case, I want to re-create the vision when the cheetah is finding and catching its prey. <br /><br />
                1. Sight: surrounding is motion blur(fast), shake the lens<br />
                2. Sound: sound of wind, sound of running cheetah(fast)<br /><br /></p>
            <h2>Step3: Create interactions with the scenarios.</h2>
            <p> Users need to put efforts to catch the prey. <br /><br />
                1. keep pressing the 'space' to increase the cheetah's velocity <br />
                2. move the mouse around to find the prey.<br /></p>
            <br /><br />
            <h2>Design about Cheetah</h2>
            <p>Cheetah Habitat: According to the African Wildlife Foundation, cheetahs can be found in dry forests, grasslands, open plains and desert regions. so the environment I design based on dry forest</p><br />
            <img src="../image/dryforest.png"><br />
            <p>Cheetah's prey: Cheetahs enjoy their meat, and some of their common prey animals are smaller antelopes and wildebeests, guineafowl, gray duikers, impalas, kudus, gazelles, springboks, ostriches, jackals, hares and even birds. However, in my prototype, I use green cube to represent prey.</p>

            <br /><br />

            <h2>Future Iteration</h2>
            <p>1. Shake camera when run<br />
                2. Better motion blur when run<br />
                3. Make users hungry first.<br />
                4. Increase the animation framerate when press forward key.</p>
            <br /><br />


            <h2>Second Task: </h2>
            <p>try to simulate octopus experience of change skinâ€™s color and texture.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Octopuses are mollusks. The cause of mollusk's color change is the morphological change of pigment cells in its skin. They have a layer of pigment cells in their skin, and there are a lot of them. These pigment cells contain pigments that can take on different colors such as red, yellow, brown and black. <br /> <br />

                Octopuses change its skins color and texture to used for camouflage and blend into the environment so that the predictor cannot see them.<br /> <br /> </p>
            <img src="../image/oct1.gif"><br/>
            <h2>Design Concept </h2>
            <p> In order to recreate the experience octopus changing color to blend into the environment when they want to hide from their predators,  
            I used transparent paper to create a octopus. I put a RGB LED and color sensor inside the octopus toy.Once the color sensor sense the surrounding color, the led change the same color.

            <h2>Future Iteration</h2>
            <p>It's important to think about how to make the user scared at the first place and want to blend into the surrounding.
