            <h2>Final Proposal </h2>
            <p>In this week, I would love to keep researching penguins, and bring up three enrichment ideas for them. </p> <br />
            <h2>Animal: Penguins </h2>
            <div class="big-img"><img src="../image/finalpenguin.png"></div><br /><br />
            <h2>Pervious observation on penguins:<a href="week6.html"> Ethogram</a></h2>
            <p>Based on the pervious observations and research, I concluded the behavior of penguins, including: surface swimming, underwater swimming, porpoising,locomotion, preening,affiliative and feeding.</p>
            <div class="big-img"> <img src="../image/penguinbehavior.png"></div><br /><br />
            <h2>Proposal 1: </h2>
            <p>During the observation, I found out some interesting behavior. For example, sometime, two penguins preening each other neck. According to the research, preening can be a part of the breeding behaviour. Among couples, it is a sign of love when they clean each others feathers on that parts which other hardly can reach. <br /><br />

                Preening, a type of grooming, is a very important process in keeping the feathers healthy. Preening also helps keep their feathers in great condition(tip-top shape) so that they can keep as warm as possible. Preening is for a penguin very important, even more it is essential for survival.By oiling their feathers with a mix from the preen gland, they make their feathers waterproof. Only so they are protected against the water infiltration and cold.<br /><br />
                The penguins preen during a lot of the time when they are just standing around on the nest or with their eggs or chicks. Actually, they preen every day, winter or summer.
            </p>
           
            <p>However, as everyone can imagine, some areas on penguins bodies, such as neck, can be very difficult or impossible to reach by themselves. If a penguin cannot find a mate, it might be a problem to tackle this problem. Therefore, my enrichment device is to help them preening their neck, or the back of their head.</p>
            <!--            As you can imagine, some areas on penguinsâ€™ bodies (like the back of their heads) might be very difficult or impossible to reach with their beaks. There are two ways that penguins tackle this problem. Penguins can spread the oil along their wings and then rub the top of their head along the wing margins. Or, a friend or mate can help them reach those tough to get spots. When penguins preen each other it is called allo-preening or mutual preening and it can be a courtship and bonding behavior. Penguins preen themselves both in and out of the water. When swimming, they can access those harder to reach areas.-->
