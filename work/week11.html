            <h2>Final Project First Prototype </h2>
            <p>In this week, I need to do the first prototype of the ideas </p> <br />
            <h2>Animal: Penguins </h2>
            <div class="big-img"><img src="../image/finalpenguin.png"></div><br /><br />

            <h2>Concept </h2>
            <p>Penguins are seabirds that naturally spend a vast amount of their life in the ocean swimming and foraging for food. However, last time I observed the a genguin in Central Park Zoo, that genguin did not swim within half an hour. And others penguins who swim in the pool, I cannot find the porpoising behavior among them.According to the <a class="research" href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/22/3121">research</a>,In th wild, birds mainly porpoised at the start and end of a trip. One explanation of porpoising might be an escape behaviour from predators. Some penguins are not as good as other penguins when porpoising. So this is a behavior need to be trained. Hence, In the final proposal, I want to design a device to encourage penguins porpoise.</p>

            <br />
            <p>According to <a class="research" href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1460&context=icwdm_usdanwrc">research</a>, A penguin's eyes are adapted to see clearly both in air and under water and have binocular vision. They contain single cones with a visual
                pigment maximally sensitive to either violet or ultraviolet. Thereofre, Penguins have color vision and are sensitive to violet, blue, and green wavelengths of light and possibly to ultraviolet light as well.
                Hence, I want to use violet or UV ball to encourage penguins to porpoise. <br /><br />
