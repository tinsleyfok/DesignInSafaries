            <h1>Assignment: Pet Store Visit + Interview </h1>
            <p>In this week, Mariah and I visited to a pet shop called DOG & CO to observe human-animal interactions. DOG & CO is a pet shop offering a curated selection of cute pet products. There are a few dogs and dogs' owner insides the stores selecting dogs' supplies and toys. Some dogs’ owner talked to their pets and some owners used different toys to interact with their pets.There is a dog hide in the tent, and its owner tried to make it out of the tent. <br/><br/>

                There are lots of product for pets, including clothes, toys, collar, etc. Mariah found that the wool toys are interesting since the wool material seldom used for pets’ toys. But we ended up being told that wool is good for poppies who like to chew but don’t have super powerful teeth where hard rubber is better for bigger dogs. Besides, wool can also clean dogs’ teeth. And I used rubber cactus-look toys filled with prickly texture to interact with Pomeranian, who initially tried to bite but gave up after two bites. This confirms what the clerk said. However, I wonder are these materials good for dogs’ health, since wool toys definitely not a good choice for human to bite. And I also wonder are the cute toys to please or attract human or dog itself? I do not think the dogs can recognize what the toy is. Some of the toys even have sounds. Is the sound really what dogs need? So, these products become somewhat human-centric yet animal-centric.<br/><br/>

                The products insides the stores are cute, and I would say these products definitely can attract human to buy them. The manufactory will design products that can attract human, since human pay the money for their pets. And they may not be able to do research on what dogs like and not design the products based on dogs’ preference. They may design products that is attractive and durable. The clerks also told them, lots of pets’ supply manufactory used to design babies’ toys or babies’ clothes. And then they now also design pets’ clothes and toys too. However, human to animal design especially clothing does not always work. For example, basic things like a dog t-shirt should have the sleeves on the front not the side like human.<br/><br/>

                Besides, the staff insides the store also points out that puzzles are great for stimulating dogs’ mind when they cannot go outside. I know that dogs need lots of love and attention. And the pet owners need to walk their dogs every day. If dogs cannot go outsides, we need to give them toys to keep them busy. Therefore, If I design an enrichment for dog, I would design toys especially for them. The toy does not need be pretty or cute but playful for dog itself.
